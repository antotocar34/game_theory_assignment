game theory -- infection from interaction.


There are 2 players.


Every player has two types, whether they are infected or not.


Two choices interaction or not.


p - probability of getting infected
I_j = probability of j being infected.
C_i = Cost to i from getting infected

p * C_i = Expected cost of infecting.

p * C_i = I_j * C_i


e - probability that player i infects player j.
I_i - probability of player i being infected.

D_i - Player i's disutility from infecting player j.


B_i - Benefit to i from interaction.


So the utility function for player i is as follows.

U_i(Interacting) = B_i - ( (I_j * C_i) + (I_i * D_i))

So 
utility_from_interaction = benefit - cost
utility_from_interaction = benefit from interaction 
                           - cost from infection
utility_from_interaction = benefit from interaction 
                           - (cost from getting infected
                            + cost from infecting)



U_i(Interacting) = B_i - ( (I_j * C_i) + (I_i * D_i))

U_i(Not Interacting) = 0

Ideas

Extend it to N players?

So what we need is some sort of strategic interaction effect. In what form can this arise?

Well if I know that some percentage of the population is infected, and that individuals derive negative utility from 
infecting, then I should be able to derive something.

Selfish players and non-selfish players.

If player is selfish, them expressing interest is indicative of them being _more_ likely to be infected. <- Can I encode this in the model?

If player is non-selfish, them expressing interest is indicative of them being _less_ likely to be infected. <- Can I encode this in the model?


What is the setup of the game?



               Interact     Don't
             |            |  
   Interact  |  Ui, Uj    |   0
             |            |
     Don't   |     0      |   0
             |            |

Immediate Consequence: (Don't, Don't) will always be a NE. -> Does this generalise to N players? 
                                                                - Yes of course.

However (Don't, Interact, Interact) is not necessarily a nash equilibrium, because 


                       (Interact, Interact) is a NE iff U_i, U_j > 0. -> Does this generalise?

What is the intuition behind this? Well, with (Don't, Don't) the players are committing to a state where they cannot possibly get a positive payoff.

If one of the utility functions has a negative payoff, then that one player will never want to _risk_ the interaction and therefore he will never interact.

Ok, pretty simple game so far.


-- Q. What happens if the players have a negative payoff from being rejected?

Well let's have a situation where

Let R < 0, be the cost to utility of being rejected.


               Interact      Don't
             |            |  
   Interact  |  Ui, Uj    |    R, 0
             |            |
     Don't   |   0, R     |    0, 0
             |            |


If U_i, U_j > R, then NE is preserved at (Interact, Interact). -- TODO -> Double check for precise information.

(Don't, Don't) is still a NE.

INTERPRETATION
--------------
-- Situation where individuals pre-commit to decision before informing the other party.
    -- Ensures the game is static.


IDEAS
-----
-- This might be more interesting with N players.

-- Maybe it would be better if the person who rejects incurs a cost to utility. I mean this is not really gonna help.


N Player Case
-------------

In the N player case the utility function for not interacting coudl be different.
Because there is an incentive to deviate from the _Don't_ strategy.
